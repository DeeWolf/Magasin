Welcome to first project r√©alize during testing week at CEFIM (Tours)

For this project, we need to do a itemshop with 6 or more rows, and a indication of prices, quantity, and more

Bonuses are using so, like a way for little parts to transform to big parts if more than fives little parts, 
a real-time view of total amount of products (and by row too)

a script Java was used for link with calculates button (
    It was edited like, two functions, one for clear all products, a second for calculate the price.
)

This project was realized in four days with many help,
others programmers of CEFIM, assets from internet, pictures for design from pexel.fr
