# Magasin


That's a full project realize during testing week at CEFIM school in Tours, France. 

During this week, we need to create a shop with multiples items, who he user can buy with increment or decrement quantity. 
Prices are visualize in real-time (Javascript functions) 
Front are made by myself, with help of pexel.fr for the picture. 

All files are upload on Github, so you can check the project, and tell me if you see a new way to optimize my code !
